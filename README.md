# Environment-Aware-Automatic-Robot-Optimization-Using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
The method optimizes a base robot's dimensions using a custom genetic algorithm and Reinforcement Learning to improve task performance. Terrain-specific optimizations and 3D model integration make it more realistic. In a test, the optimized robot, trained for 20M steps on flat ground, achieved 257% of the base robot's score, proving its efficiency.
